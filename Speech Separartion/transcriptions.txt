what is it that I want them to know within the first few minutes of meeting me and that's really hard this isn't something that's an easy thing to do but you want to just try to stay away and you actually did a good job I would say you weren't I've had you know I well I'm from Franklin mass and I went to such and Such high school and then I went to Curry college and then I did this job and you didn't do that which was good but you want to try to stay away from what I kind of would describe as like the chronology of your background and more as a summary of who you are as a candidate what you're looking for where your passion lies as it relates to the position weakness that you have and weaknesses when things are going aren't going my way I tend to like stress myself out to the max and I just don't know where to go from there but then when it all

how do you spell internally this is something that I go through and so these are the things that I do to make sure that it doesn't affect my work you give me an example of an accomplishment you've had and what that tells us about you so I think one of my greatest accomplishments is the general focus of me going to college because initially graduating high school I didn't I wasn't planning on going to college I was a c student High School wasn't involved in anything basically just went to school and left and didn't really do much and then coming to college I had that mindset of I'm just going to like do whatever and then I got involved on campus I ended up getting Dean's list both semesters of my freshman year and then both semester sophomore year and then it continued up until my senior of me Dean's list every almost every semester a couple smashes I haven't put close enough I'm extremely involved on campus I wasn't orientation leader I have been involved in curry Theatre and I'm participating in all these specific things

aspect of my life that I initially had never expected to happen so I think again very good very good sort of common way to answer an interview question I think taking it up a notch is to complete the question which I kind of fed you which was in that what does that tell us about you is it worker and that's usually not how that question is going to be as they say what can you give me a sense of an accomplishment that you've had but what you want in your brain to do is to translate that for them so your example of making Deans list so I didn't think I was you know going to go to college and then I went to school and I made Deans list immediately and what that can tell you about me is that once I get myself going I'm really committed that I've got great time management skills you know I took me a little while to really put a commitment to education but once I did I was committed and that's where I am now and start to think about what those what

Transcription of segment 360-420 seconds:
creative aspect into a situation so again I would encourage you to think about what sets you apart what makes you truly different and oftentimes look at your combination of experiences because most people won't have the exact same background as you so if you piece together the different areas that make you different so maybe the combination of event planning plus the theater or something that is a real interesting cross section that then brings a certain caliber to the workplace and kind of figure out what that is and I think the other part of it is anytime you have an opportunity to talk about a story or an example that that could have been a good another opportunity to to provide an example to support what you're saying in when you answer that question do you have any questions for us I don't have any questions thank you we always want to have questions prepared prior to coming into an interview and oftentimes what happens is just through the back and forth of the interview those questions get naturally answered that said you do want to have some additional questions or have questions that are most likely

PR agency for XYZ company can you tell me a little bit about how that might impact the work of this area that I'm interviewing for so that's the way to show that you've been engaged and you've been following them and that you really interested in them as an organisation and it also gives you a chance to ask a really good question level is at above average of a typical College student I think this feedback is intended to take you to the next level and to be more on the professional seasoned professional level of interviewing so it's not an organism I think a lot of times students think it's just answering the questions and there's a right way to answer wrong way to answer and it's an ABC it's not that it's really a back and forth conversation and you should be
